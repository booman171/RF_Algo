# RF_Algo
We are creating an algorithm to  identify anomalous or adversary actions with RF data (replay, jamming, attack, etc.).
Our initial objective is to create a classifier to determine what type of signal we are receiving (z-wve, wifi, gsm, etc.).
From there we will use the signals attributes ( power, location, frequency, pulse) to determine the actions.
